## CNN models for CIFAR-10 using PyTorch
PyTorch has implemented a lot of classical and useful models in `torchvision.models`, but these models are configured towards the ImageNet dataset and not a lot of implementations have been emphasized on CIFAR-10 datasets. But CIFAR-10 is a great dataset for beginners to manipulate and play with since it doesn't require that much storage space. So in this repo I'm hoping to implement those classical models that's directly made and trained towards CIFAR-10.
