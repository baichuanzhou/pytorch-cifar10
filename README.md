CNN models for CIFAR-10 using PyTorch\
PyTorch has implemented a lot of classical and useful models in torchvision.models, but these models are more towards the ImageNet dataset and not a lot of implementations have been emphasized on CIFAR-10 datasets. So in this repo I'm hoping to implement those classical models that's directly made and trained for CIFAR-10.
